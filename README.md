# MTLNFM
Abstract: With the advancement of machine learning, the field of healthcare has been increasingly utilizing machine learning to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. Predicting patientsâ€™ clinical outcomes is a challenging task that requires consideration of numerous patient characteristics, treatment interventions, and environmental factors. In addition, The missingness of patient information and poor data quality make it challenging to accurately identify patient outcomes, especially when relying solely on machine learning techniques in single-task learning. The advent of multi-task learning (MTL) shows great promise in handling different tasks in the context of healthcare for clinical outcome prediction. In this work, we presented a novel MTL framework for patient clinical outcome prediction based on neural factorization machine (MTLNFM). We also employed a novel pre-processing strategy that can handle missing data by labeling them instead of the traditional methods of deletion or imputation. We conducted comparative and contrastive experiments to predict frailty status, hospitalization days, and mortality simultaneously. The experimental results showed that our MTL model achieved 0.7514, 0.6722 and 0.7754 in AUROC, exceeding the performance in single-task models. The case analysis also demonstrated that our model consists of both independent and shared information components for each task that is relatively more robust and closer to the real patient distribution. In conclusion, we believe that our proposed method is very promising for clinical health outcomes prediction, especially in assisting research with limited data.![image](https://github.com/UF-HOBI-Yin-Lab/MTLNFM/assets/54319233/147cf86d-e3a1-4893-9689-58541d92cae3)
