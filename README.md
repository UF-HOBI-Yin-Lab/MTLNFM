# MTLNFM
Abstract: Accurately predicting patient clinical outcomes is a complex task that requires integrating diverse factors, including individual characteristics, treatment histories, and environmental influences. This challenge is further exacerbated by missing data and inconsistent data quality, which often hinder the effectiveness of traditional single-task learning (STL) models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these limitations by jointly modeling related prediction tasks and leveraging shared information. In this study, we propose MTLNFM, a novel MTL framework built upon Neural Factorization Machines, to predict patient clinical outcomes simultaneously. To address data quality issues, we introduce a novel preprocessing strategy that explicitly labels missing values, avoiding the limitations of conventional deletion or imputation methods. We conducted extensive comparative experiments, demonstrating that MTLNFM outperforms STL baselines across all tasks, achieving AUROC scores of 0.751, 0.672, and 0.775, respectively. A detailed case analysis further revealed that MTLNFM effectively integrates both task-specific and shared representations, resulting in more robust and realistic predictions aligned with actual patient outcome distributions. Overall, our findings suggest that MTLNFM is a promising and practical solution for clinical outcome prediction, particularly in settings with limited or incomplete data, and can support more informed clinical decision-making and resource planning.
